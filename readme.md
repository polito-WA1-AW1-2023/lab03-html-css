# Lab 03: Getting started with HTML and CSS

In this repository you will find the following file:

- `lab03-html-css.pdf`: the pdf file containing the lab specification.
- `FilmLibrary.png`: a representation of the desired application's layout.
- `index-not-responsive.html`: the HTML page designed to be rendered only on a desktop screen (Exercise 1).
- `index.html`: the same HTML page designed in a responsive way (Exercise 2).
- `custom.css`: a CSS file used by both the previous two HTML files.
